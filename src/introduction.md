# Introduction

## Overview

The goal of this book is to be a good starting point for people new to embedded Rust programming. If you are new to Rust
and/or new to embedded programming, you should be able gain knowledge from this book.

This book is separated into two main parts:
- Embedded Rust Programming
- Open Rustbot

Both parts of this book can be a starting point. However, they offer different learning experiences that may suit
different people. The "Embedded Rust Programming" part goes over one concept at a time with increasing
difficulty and the "Open Rustbot" part walks through building and programming a rover using Rust. Below is a list of
required hardware for each section.
