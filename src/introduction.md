# Introduction

## Overview

This book is separated into two parts. The first part will focus on getting started with using Rust to develop for STM32
microcontrollers. The second part will walk you through the **Open Rust Bot** kit.

Throughout this book we will be using the STM32F103 "Blue Pill" development board. This microcontroller was chosen due
to its availability and low cost. These development boards can be found for as low as $2.00 on AliExpress.
