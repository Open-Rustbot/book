# Introduction

## Overview

The goal of this book is to be a good starting point for people new to embedded Rust programming. If you are new to Rust
and/or new to embedded programming, you should be able gain knowledge from this book.

This book is separated into two main parts:
- Embedded Rust Programming
- Open Rustbot

Both parts of this book can be a starting point. However, they offer different learning experiences that may suit
different people.

The first part of this book uses an STM32f103 "blue pill" microcontroller. Each section of this part will go through
a new concept and require different components, but all will require the STM32f103 microcontroller. Below is a full
parts list for each section.



This book is separated into two parts. The first part will focus on getting started with using Rust to develop for STM32
microcontrollers. The second part will walk you through the **Open Rust Bot** kit.

Throughout this book we will be using the STM32F103 "Blue Pill" development board. This microcontroller was chosen due
to its availability and low cost. These development boards can be found for as low as $2.00 on AliExpress.
